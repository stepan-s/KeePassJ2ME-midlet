x - keep porting JavaKeePass into KeePassJ2ME (what do you do with List?)

+ finalKey is wrong
Correct finalKey: 4616497a7cc3bb14c0a3225dc99f335d21475f0276f20bf543d0c6a86ef68362
Wrong  finalKey : 312966...

+ masterSeed2 is correct
+ pKey is correct

+ finalKey matched!
+ database decrypted!

x - but my program doesn't think so. why?
  + plaintext contents length is different.  1079 in Java, 1072 in J2ME
  + I need to apply padding manually

* 6/22  
- check KeePass forum for feedback
x - write automatic script to insert key file to jar file
x - test this on phone - it's fast!  woo hoo!!
- learn how to do tree
+ PDAPDemo -> File browser is close
+ UIDemo -> List
+ UIDemo -> Text
+ UIDemo -> Choice Group


x - design the tree view
  + just do this
https://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=175898
  + hierarchical view - can't do
  + each entry has an icon
  + password is by default masked
  + default screen gives list of level 0, 1 items (i.e. groups)
  + if you select a group, it will show list of the entries in the group
  + pointer should start in "General" folder
  + be careful that Groups, as well as Subgroups, can have entries
  
* implement the tree view
x - put more data in Database.kdb
x - change round to 1
x - test
no - read the list of groups from kdb, and create tree data structure
  no - create TreeElement class
x - show root groups on screen
x - catch selection event
x - make a new list and show it
x - reflect entries in the new list
x - can't go down more than one deep?

x - in MessageBox, command listener isn't set correctly.  send in MIDlet instead of Display, and register listerner to that. 
x - show entry
no - add "up" button
x - add "go up" entry

* bugs
x - MIDlet should exit when it can't find database file

x - create SourceForge project

x - show icon in the menu
x - in the entry message box - doesn't work on Nokia 6620
x - read password
x - use password to decrypt kdb
* lock and remove key after 1 hour
x - learn timer
x - close & open database on timer
x - stop timer when there's some action

* create kdb download tool
+ Use Java
x - find a way to browse directories
x - create program to do it
* do this to create jar file
http://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=633847&messageID=3683724

- decide on directory structure

jar.exe
jli.dll
KeePassInstaller.jar
KeePassInstaller.bat
images/
org/
META-INF/

* 7/12

x - Think through the scenarios ... If record store already has data, then what?
  + Overwrite it, for now
  x - so, remove it.
  
x - before copying KDB into record store, remove the content first, or make sure it's empty, etc.

- it says "Downloading ..." while decrypting KDB

- if LOCAL is selected, copy kdb in jar into file into record store

- HTML selection page (default to keepassserver.info)

- Server makes sure the input string is 8 digit number, and nothing else
- Server introduces delay if the same IP address keeps making requests
