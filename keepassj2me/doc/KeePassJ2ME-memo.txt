- learn how to do tree
+ PDAPDemo -> File browser is close
+ UIDemo -> List
+ UIDemo -> Text
+ UIDemo -> Choice Group


x - design the tree view
  + just do this
https://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=175898
  + hierarchical view - can't do
  + each entry has an icon
  + password is by default masked
  + default screen gives list of level 0, 1 items (i.e. groups)
  + if you select a group, it will show list of the entries in the group
  + pointer should start in "General" folder
  + be careful that Groups, as well as Subgroups, can have entries
  
* implement the tree view
x - put more data in Database.kdb
x - change round to 1
x - test
no - read the list of groups from kdb, and create tree data structure
  no - create TreeElement class
x - show root groups on screen
x - catch selection event
x - make a new list and show it
x - reflect entries in the new list
x - can't go down more than one deep?

x - in MessageBox, command listener isn't set correctly.  send in MIDlet instead of Display, and register listerner to that.

* 7/12

x - Think through the scenarios ... If record store already has data, then what?
  + Overwrite it, for now
  x - so, remove it.
  
x - before copying KDB into record store, remove the content first, or make sure it's empty, etc.

x - if LOCAL is selected, copy kdb in jar into file into record store

x - it says "Downloading ..." while decrypting KDB.  it should say "decrypting ..." or something
x - HTML selection page (default to keepassserver.info)
x - error out if HTML is wrong
x - don't install new KDB if you already have one

* 7/13
x - Server makes sure the input string is 8 digit number, and nothing else
match [0-9] occuring 8 times

x - Server removes the file after download
x - Server removes the file after 10 min (5 min clock algorithm)

  + Use cron
http://www.scrounge.org/linux/cron.html

* test

x - even if I already have database in file, I need an option to reload
x - implement reload logic

x - if file doesn't exist in server, server should send 404 or something

no - app stops after downloading my kdb and then decrypting it successfully

no - my Database.kdb gives me "bad database signature".  HUH?

- wait for RimuHosting's answer about backup
- find good user agreement from somewhere

- learn KeePass API ... does it provide good TwoFish API?
  + KDB header (first 124 byte of KDB) is unencrypted, so do NOT encrypt this part.  Encrypt the rest.
  + Use TwoFish
    no + Twofish_prepare_key()
    + TwofishClass.init()
    + TwofishClass.PadEncrypt(), PadDecrypt()

  + Password -> key transofmation is SHA256, enc with master seed2 * rounds, SHA256, then hash with master seed1.
  + but this is not exported as API ... 
x - design the kdb uploader (maybe do it as a plugin?)
  + Just do SHA256 for 6,000 times on the PIN - perhaps 16 digits.  key = SHA256(PIN) * 6,000
  + Encrypt encrypted part of kdb with AES(key)
  + upload it to keepassserver.info
  + download this from KeePassJ2ME
  + decrypt this

x - make sure all the fields are filled (mEditKDB, mEditURL, mEditUsername, mEditPassword, mEditEncCode)
no - securely generate 16 digit number
  - need to add random library in source code
  - NewRandom.Initialize()
  - NewRandom.GetRandomBuffer()

  	m_random.Initialize();
	m_random.GetRandomBuffer(m_pSessionKey, PWM_SESSION_KEY_SIZE);

* do it again with OpenSSL
x - get rid of KeePassLib dependency
x - include and link to OpenSSL random

* securely generate 16 digit number
x - set up random
x - generate 16 bytes

x - show the random number
no - move random number generation routine to somewhere else
x - make routine to do SHA256 6,000 times
x - invoke it from update()

x - read KDB

* 10/11- 
- study this

+ Initialize WinHTTP with WinHttpOpen
+ Connect to a server with WinHttpConnect
+ Open a request (such as POST) with WinHttpOpenRequest

  HINTERNET hRequest = WinHttpOpenRequest( hConnect, L"GET", NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0);

+ Send the request with WinHttpSendRequest  

+ Then do WinHttpWriteData - this actually posts, maybe?
  Make sure to set dwTotalLength to the lenght of data

+ You can skip WinHttpWriteData() by setting lpOptional in WinHttpSendRequest()
  
// + Maybe get result with WinHttpReadData or WinHttpQueryDataAvailable

* post it
x - try using this - works!!

x - put kdbfile as POST parameter
x - post to http://keepassserver.info/submit.php

later - search for secure PHP username / password script
later - maybe I need to install MySQL?
later - install the script
later - test

+ So I need to add "debug" option in do_nt.bat.  Check out in CVS, keepassj2me/uploader/do_nt_debug.bat on how to do this.
