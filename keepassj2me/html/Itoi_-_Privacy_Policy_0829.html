maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the personal information we

sensitive information to us (e.g., account passwords and payment-related identifiable information) via SSL (secured socket layer) protocol in the interest of heightened privacy protection and information integrity.  </span></p><p class="P19"> </p><p class="P19">In addition, only employees who need the information to perform their duties are granted access to personally identifiable

purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options. </p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P7">The Company qualifies for the alternative option;

request should be sent (email or postal mail).  You may contact us in two ways.  Send an email to [<span class="T9">keepass@itoillc.com</span>].  Alternatively, you may contact us at the address set
