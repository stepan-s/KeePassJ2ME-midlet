Todo:
- Progress bar for download
- Add BT source
- Key cache
- Sync kdb
- Search: sorting?
- File browser - select last file?
- icons 32x32, etc. (see packer)
- check kdb password in UTF-8 (check String.getBytes())
- reorder fields in record view?
- generate key files?
- password generator?
- favorites
- UI check and refactor code
- Optimize index changes when add/change/delete entries/groups
- Extrude search result from database class
- `bak` files (backup on write, daily?)
Priority:
- "Cancel" handling when data source select, select url & etc
- HTTP/HTTPS data source with file list
- Tests for kdb operations

1.4.0
* Create, edit and save kdb (add/change/delete groups/entries)

1.3.0
Main:
* Added `Keydb` - KDB manager with lower memory usage
* Added support for key files (file system, JAR)
* Changed `ls` format (list kdb in jar): each line contain name - string in UTF
  line index correspond kdb name (first line -> `kdb/0`, second -> `kdb/1`, ...)
  (require keepassj2me-packer 1.2.1)
* Icons lazy loading, start faster
* Disabling icons from setup, decrease memory usage
* Added `Setup` (watch dog timeout, download URL, etc)
* Save to RecordStore only KDB received from internet (`last downloaded`)
* Remember last dir for `File browser`

KDB Browser:
* Added search by `title`, `url`, `username`, `note` (sub string)

* Removed support for `Database.kdb` in jar, instead use keepassj2me-packer 

1.2.0
File browser:

  For local store added menu item (when available)

* Improved form for download parameters
* Added progress bar for decrypting

KDB Browser:
* Browser Separated from midlet class
* Record view class

  (file `/kdb/ls` - list files in `/kdb` folder)
* Changed type of fields `url`, `user` and `pass` to text
  for allow copy to clipboard (where available)

Other:
* New midlet icon

  because file browsing don't work normally on the phone
  later it replace with bookmarks - for all
